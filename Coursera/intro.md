# Algorithms 1

* Intermediate level survey course
* Two Parts (Algorithms 1 and Algorithms 2)

#### Why Study algorithms ?
The apllications of algorithm is broad and far-reaching. We need to minimize the computer time required to complete problems. 

Have ancient roos, back to the time of Euclid. Formalized by Church and Turing in 1930. Main reason, is to solve problems that otherwise cannot be formulated and solved. For eg., Network connectivity.

Another reason, intellectual stimulation. Donald Knuth - "An algorithm need to be seen to believed". Linus Trovalds - "Bad programmers worry about their code; good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships" 
Algorithms are omputational models and are fast replacing mathematical models to create solutions. This helps the users simlate the natural laws. 

Another important reason is fun and profit. Good chance of jobs in the technological industry.
