## Mathematical Models
Developed by Doanld Knuth in the 1960s
Total Time = Cost of each step * Frequency

* Count the cost of only the significant operation
* Tilde Notation: ignore lower order terms
    * (1/6)N^3 + 20N + 16 -> ~(1/6)N^3
    * (1/6)N^3 + 100N^(4/3) + 56 -> (1/6)N^3
    * (1/6)N^3 - (1/2)N^2 + (1/3)N -> 1/6)N^3


In principle, accurate mathematical models for algorithms can be made. But in practice, the formulas used can be complicated. The advanced mathematical models required for analysis might be best left for experts. 

In this course, we will be lokoing at approximate models
